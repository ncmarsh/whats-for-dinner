## About the Project

The goal of this project was to create an application that will lift some of the burden of deciding what to make for dinner. The "What's for Dinner?" application allows the user to search for online recipes based on ingredients he/she may have on-hand. Additionally, users will have the option to save recipes for future use, which can easily be converted to a PDF to be used offline, or for the more tangible owners of the printer, printed out on paper.

## Usage

This project can be used by anyone has an assortment of ingredients on-hand, but doesn't know what to make for dinner. The below outlines all major features of  this project:

* **Search by ingredient or keyword:** Users can search for a recipe using ingredients or keywords (e.g, type of cuisine). Ingredients are individually added to a working ingredient list to allow for larger searches.

* **Taco Tuesday Button:**  When clicked, a search for taco-related recipes is conducted.

* **Random Recipe Button:** When clicked, a search for recipes is conducted based on a random ingredient or keyword.  

* **Save Recipes:** When results are populated, the user has the option to save individual recipes, which can be viewed on their “Saved Recipes” page. Saved recipes are viewable as cards, which can be removed. 

* **PDF Download:** On saved recipe cards, PDF buttons can be clicked to download a PDF version of the recipe page to be saved for offline use.
